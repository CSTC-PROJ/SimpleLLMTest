# SimpleLLMTest

This is a simple LLM test to help understand how things chain together.  It's not overly elaborate and at this time has 3 key features
- A guardrail using FAISS - Uses embedded terms as a pre and post LLM message
- Ollama with a gemma:2b model
- A flash api to interact with FAISS
- A nodejs front end to simply talk to the GR and LLM
